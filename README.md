# HuffmanCodes

This code was designed to implement Huffman codes in the way I've been taught in my Algorithms and Data Structures university classes.
As mere homework, the program is not the most efficient way to encode text files.

It takes the textToEncode.txt file as an input, and it returns encodedFile.txt (with encoded text file) and keyFile.txt (a key for potential decoding).
Mind that it is needed to provide a path to your own textToEncode.txt file in the code.
